# Roadmap

The OSM team uses [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/milestones) and [GitHub Project Boards](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/projects) to track the progress of the project.

# High Level Overview
At a high level, these are some of the scenarios and features we plan on working toward supporting and iterating on:

- Hardening of the project with a rigorous testing environment.
- Implement SMI Traffic Metrics and build tooling to leverage it.
- Iterate on the current Ingress/Egress functionality, experience, workflow.
- Iterating on existing tools for debugging the OSM control plane and data plane.
- Leverage xDS v2 protocol when limited by SMI to provide a "no cliffs" design
- Iterate on performance
- Extend OSM to support VMs, hybrid and multicluster scenarios

... and much more (in our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/issues)). Please file issues for scenarios and features you'd like to OSM support.
